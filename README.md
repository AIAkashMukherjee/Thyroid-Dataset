5. Hx Radiotherapy: History of radiotherapy treatment for any condition.
6. Thyroid Function: The status of thyroid function, possibly indicating if there are any abnormalities.
7. Physical Examination: Findings from a physical examination of the patient, which may include palpation of the thyroid gland and surrounding structures.
8. Adenopathy: Presence or absence of enlarged lymph nodes (adenopathy) in the neck region.
9. Pathology: Specific types of thyroid cancer as determined by pathology examination of biopsy samples.
10. Focality: Whether the cancer is unifocal (limited to one location) or multifocal (present in multiple locations).
11. Risk: The risk category of the cancer based on various factors, such as tumor size, extent of spread, and histological type.
12. T: Tumor classification based on its size and extent of invasion into nearby structures.
13. N: Nodal classification indicating the involvement of lymph nodes.
14. M: Metastasis classification indicating the presence or absence of distant metastases.
15. Stage: The overall stage of the cancer, typically determined by combining T, N, and M classifications.
16. Response: Response to treatment, indicating whether the cancer responded positively, negatively, or remained stable after treatment.
17. Recurred: Indicates whether the cancer has recurred after initial treatment.
